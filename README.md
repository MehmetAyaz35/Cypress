# Cypress Testing Suite

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of Cypress tests designed to automate end-to-end testing for web applications. These tests are aimed at ensuring the functionality, performance, and reliability of web interfaces.

## Features
- Comprehensive end-to-end tests
- Integration with various web applications
- Automated browser testing scripts

## Prerequisites
To run these tests, you will need:
- Node.js installed on your computer.
- Cypress installed globally or in your project.

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone [repository-url]
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd [directory-name]
   ```
3. **Install Cypress (if not already installed)*:
   ```bash
   npm install cypress --save-dev
   ```
4. **Install other project dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Running Tests
To open Cypress and run the tests interactively:
   ```bash
   npx cypress open
   ```

This command will open the Cypress Test Runner, where you can execute individual test suites interactively.

For running tests via the command line without the Test Runner interface:
   ```bash
   npx cypress run
   ```
This command will run all tests headlessly in the Electron browser by default. You can specify other browsers like Chrome, Firefox, etc., with the --browser flag.
